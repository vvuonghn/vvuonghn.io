Research assistant at University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR (Jun 2023 - Present)
•  Research in 3D Scene Understanding: 3D reconstruction, 3D Point Cloud Object Detection and Segmentation, 360 view from multi-views
• 3D Generation: 3D Reconstruction, text-to-3D, images-to-3D, NeRF, 3D Gaussian Splatting, Diffusion model, LLMs
• Advisor: Prof. Susan Gauch and Prof. John Gauch

---------
Research Engineer
VinAI, HCMC, Vietnam (Mar 2021 - Jun 2023)
• Implemented a 360 surround view monitoring system from four cameras around a car and perspective projection from fisheye image (front/rear/left/right views, wheel views) which deployed success on VinFast E34. Technical based on camera intrinsic, extrinsic calibration, 3D object model, blending image
• Implemented calibration algorithms: Intrinsic camera, Extrinsic fisheye cameras-vehicle coordinate system(Ego), LiDAR-Camera, auto-calibration
• Implemented algorithms for mapping pixel index between Fisheye ↔ Perspective image. Estimate distance between vehicle coordinate system(Ego) to object based on calibration
• Implemented algorithms free-space segmentation/detection based on cameras (BEV)
• Auto Parking: Support build Occupancy Grid Map (OGM) from four cameras, researched path planning method
• Researched and applied CV, ML/DL techniques to develop 3DOD from LiDAR Point Cloud

• Mentors: Dr. Binh-Son Hua

-----
AI Engineer
VCCorp(Jun 2019 - Apr 2020)
• Implemented a classification system using RNN/LSTM model that can predict the category, detect depraved content/violence in videos on social media
• Implemented a VIP (very important person) detection system on videos

------
AI Intern 
FPT Software (Mar 2017 - May 2018)
• Implemented a 3D medical Image Segmentation model, analysis, processing, and visualization of 3D image data
